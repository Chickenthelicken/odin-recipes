        <h2>About the Mousse </h2>
        <p>
            Chocolate mousse is a timeless dessert known for its rich, velvety texture and balanced sweetness. Light and airy, yet decadently chocolaty, it combines whipped cream with melted dark chocolate and a velvety egg mixture to deliver a luxurious mouthfeel that’s impressive yet approachable. This version—designed for beginners—guides you through each step so you get perfect results every time.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ ounces dark chocolate (62% cacao recommended)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>A tiny pinch of salt</li>
            <li>½ cup chilled heavy whipping cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step-By-Step Guide</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Prep the Chocolate and Butter</h4>
                <p>Break the dark chocolate into small pieces and set aside with the butter so they are ready to incorporate later.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cook Egg Mixture</h4>
                    <p>In a metal mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks, sugar, water, and salt. Place the bowl over medium-low heat and whisk continuously until the mixture becomes thick, foamy, and hot to the touch (about 145–150°F / 63–65°C). This gently cooks the eggs and dissolves the sugar.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add Chocolate and Butter</h4>
                    <p>Remove the bowl from heat and immediately whisk in the dark chocolate and butter. Stir until everything is fully melted and smooth. Allow the mixture to rest briefly so it cools to just above room temperature—warm chocolate can deflate whipped cream if added too early.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Whip the Cream</h4>
                    <p>n a separate bowl, whisk the chilled heavy cream until it reaches medium-stiff peaks. Be careful not to over-whip; overly stiff cream can create a grainy texture in the final mousse.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Fold Together</h4>
                    <p>Transfer about one-third of the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream and fold gently with a spatula to lighten. Then fold in the remaining chocolate mixture in gentle strokes to preserve the airiness of the cream.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Chill and Serve</h4>
                    <p>Spoon the finished mousse into serving dishes or glasses. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the texture to set. Serve chilled, optionally garnished with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or fresh fruit.</p>
