            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <h3>Step-By-Step Guide</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Preheat and Prepare Pan</h4>
                    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 13×9-inch baking pan so the brownies release easily after baking.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Combine Wet Ingredients</h4>
                    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted margarine (or butter), white sugar, and vanilla extract. Stir until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition until fully incorporated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add Dry Ingredients</h4>
                    <p>Into the wet mixture, stir in the all-purpose flour, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Mix until the batter is smooth and evenly blended.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Reserve Some Batter</h4>
                    <p>Set aside approximately 2 cups of the brownie batter in a separate bowl. You’ll use it later to cover the peppermint patties.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Layer Brownie Batter</h4>
                    <p>Spread the remaining batter evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add Peppermint Patties</h4>
                    <p>Unwrap each peppermint patty and arrange them in a single layer over the batter, spacing them about ½-inch apart.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cover with Remaining Batter</h4>
                    <p>Carefully spread the reserved batter over the layer of peppermint patties so they are covered./p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Bake</h4>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the edges begin to pull away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the brownie layer comes out clean or with moist crumbs—not raw batter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cool and Serve</h4>
                    <p>Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve. The cooling time allows the brownies to set and the peppermint patties to meld into the chocolate.</p>
